           <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
           <p> Hello there. <b>I'm Markus</b>. Welcome to my page.
            <br><br> 
            <b>tldr;</b>
            <br>
            I love the outdoors. 
            <br>
            I love to read. 
            <br>
            I'm a software engineer by trade. 
            <br>
            I'm looking for something new. 
            <br><br>            
            I was born and raised in Walnut Creek California, attended De La Salle High School in Concord, CA, and graduated from UCLA with a <b>BS in Computer Science</b>.
            <br>
            From 2017 - late 2022 I worked as a software engineer in a <b>large enterprise setting at Workday</b> (10s of thousands of employees) and then in a more <b>high speed and dynamic startup</b> environment at Sprig (<100 employees). 
            <br>
            So far in 2023, I've been traveling, dabbling in investing, reading philosophy, messing with chatGPT, and writing (not even close to exhaustive list). <b>"Exploring"</b> would be a good one word summary. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Now I'm entertaining a career pivot</b>. I've always been interested in transitioning roles from engineering to something a little more people facing, and now that I have some breathing room, I'm opening myself up to such a transition. I'm not giving up on software engineering... just making a conscious effort to see what lies beyond. Some roles I'm considering are <b>Product Manager, Sales Engineer, and Account Executive</b>. 
            <br>
            While exploring different adjacent roles and learning from colleagues about their experiences, I'm also <b>honing my engineering skills and staying sharp</b>, exploring side projects that I've tabled in my notes over the last 10 years. 
            <br><br>
            So please peruse. Make yourself at home. Warm yourself by the fire of my page. 
            <br>
            Contact me if you think I'd be a fit for any particular roles. I'm mainly looking in <b>SF, LA, and Austin</b>, but my resolve here can be broken with proper persuasion.
